                <h2>Pizza</h2>
                <p>
                    If you think of pizza as a flat bread cooked in an oven, then its origins go back to ancient times in the Middle East. The ancient Babylonians, Israelites, and Egyptians all ate unleavened flat breads baked in mud ovens.If you think a pizza has to have toppings, then its history dates back to the ancient Greeks and Romans. They both ate baked flat breads that were topped with olive oil and local spices. Today, we call these dishes focaccia breads.The pizza we're all familiar with the kind with tomato sauce, cheese, and toppings, did originate in Italy. Specifically, baker Raffaele Esposito from Naples is often given credit for creating the first such pizza pie.

                <p>
                    Ice cream's origins are known to reach back as far as the second century B.C., although no specific date of origin nor inventor has been undisputably credited with its discovery. We know that Alexander the Great enjoyed snow and ice flavored with honey and nectar. Biblical references also show that King Solomon was fond of iced drinks during harvesting. Historians estimate that this recipe evolved into ice cream sometime in the 16th century. England seems to have discovered ice cream at the same time, or perhaps even earlier than the Italians.

He invented Cocaâ€‘Cola on 8th May 1886 in Atlanta, Georgia. Dr Pemberton tried it out on customers at his local chemist, Jacobs' Pharmacy, where it proved so popular it immediately went on sale at five cents a glass.
